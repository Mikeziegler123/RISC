     Computer architecture is presently taught "hands-on" only
when adequate VLSI design tools are available.  The PISC is a
processor constructed from discrete TTL logic, which illustrates
the operation of both hardwired and microcoded CPUs.  An
efficient stack machine is easy to implement, and simple hardware
modifications demonstrate interrupts, memory segmentation,
microsequencers, parallelism, and pipelining.  A standalone PISC
board should be an economical and effective tool for teaching
processor design.</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><h2>Introduction</h2><p>
</p><p>
     The study of computer architecture is often an abstract,
paper exercise.  Students cannot probe the inner workings of a
single-chip microprocessor, and few discrete-logic machines are
open to student inspection.  Only universities that have VLSI
design tools can give hands-on experience in processor design and
implementation.  Less fortunate institutions can only offer their
students "book learning."</p><p>
     The Pathetic Instruction Set Computer is a model processor
constructed entirely of discrete logic, illustrating the
principles of both hardwired and microprogrammed CPUs.  Requiring
only 22 standard TTL chips (excluding memory), it is well within
the ability of a student to construct and understand.  Its
writeable microprogram store uses inexpensive EPROM and RAM.
Being fully static, it can be run at slow clock speeds or
manually single-stepped for observation.  Simple extensions
demonstrate interrupts, split instruction and data spaces,
microsequencers, parallelism, and pipelining.</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><h2>The Basic Processor</h2><p>
</p><p>
     The PISC-1a processor (Fig. 1) is designed to achieve a
maximum of functionality with a minimum of logic.  It is
remarkable for having only 16 internal control signals, and thus
a horizontal (unencoded) microinstruction only 16 bits long!</p><p>
<img src="./pisc - PATHETIC INSTRUCTION SET COMPUTER - A Minimal TTL Processor for Architecture Exploration_files/piscf1.gif"></p><p>
     The ALU comprises four 74181s, which can perform the arithmetic 
operations of add, subtract, increment, and decrement, plus
all logical operations, on 16-bit numbers.  A programmable status
latch and a 4-way multiplexer for the carry input complete the
ALU logic.  Eight 74172s provide eight 16-bit registers in a
three-port register file.  This file may simultaneously write one
register ("A"), read a second ("B"), and read or write a third
("C").  In a single clock cycle, the following occurs:</p><p>
</p><p>
  a) one register is output to the Address bus and the ALU's A
     input;<br>
 b1) another register may be output to the Data bus and the ALU's
     B input; or<br>
 b2) data from memory may be input to another register;<br>
  c) an ALU function is applied to A (and perhaps B) and the
     result is stored in the first (address) register.</p><p>
</p><p>
     There is no dedicated microsequencer; its functions are
performed by the ALU and register file.  Every microinstruction
has two phases: fetch and execute.  During the fetch phase
(illustrated in Fig. 1) a hardwired "pseudo-instruction" is
executed:</p><p>
</p><p>
  a) output R7 (the program counter) to the Address bus and the
     ALU's A input;<br>
  b) read data from memory;<br>
  c) apply the function A+1 and store the result back in R7 (at
     the trailing edge of the clock).<br>
</p><p>
     Dedicated logic causes the memory data to be stored in the
Instruction Register (IR) rather than in the register file.
During the execute phase, this instruction is performed and the
fetch instruction is reloaded into the IR.  Thus every
microinstruction requires two clock cycles.  The control logic
for this (not shown) involves only two flip-flops and a NAND
gate.  </p><p>
     Microprogram store and main program store are one and the
same.  Indeed, the PISC has characteristics of both a hardwired
CPU and a microcoded CPU.</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><h2>PISC as a Hardwired CPU</h2><p>
</p><p>
     The PISC may be viewed as a conventional CPU with a
hardwired control unit, a register-register architecture [3],
and a badly encoded instruction set vaguely reminiscent of the
PDP-11.</p><p>
     ALU operations are one- or two-operand, and include
register-register move, add, add with carry, subtract, subtract
with borrow, increment, decrement, left shift, and all logical
functions.  There is no multiply, divide, or right shift.</p><p>
     Memory operations are load and store, and have three
addressing modes:  register indirect, register indirect with
postincrement, or register indirect with postdecrement.
Postincrement addressing on R7 (the program counter) yields
immediate addressing. </p><p>
     Control instructions are ALU operations on the program
counter.  Register indirect jump (absolute or relative) and
conditional skip can be done in a single instruction.  Other
jumps and branches, and subroutine call/return, must be
explicitly coded.</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><h2>PISC as a Microprogrammed CPU</h2><p>
</p><p>
     The PISC instruction word actuates physical control signals,
and one can view the PISC as a microprogrammed CPU.  The basic
PISC implements a conventional machine inefficiently, since it
lacks the logic to separate and decode the fields of a
macroinstruction.  But the PISC excels as a zero-operand
architecture, i.e., a stack machine.</p><p>
     The fastest implementation uses threaded code [1] and a
16-bit macroinstruction.  This reduces the microinterpreter to
one microinstruction:</p><p>
         MRD PC,IP,A+1    ; mem(IP)-&gt;PC, IP+1-&gt;IP</p><p>
One register is dedicated as the macro Instruction Pointer, and
one or two others as stack pointers.  Some flexibility can be
gained by adding one microinstruction to the interpreter to use
indirect threaded code [2].</p><p>
     Logically, the microprogram store should be separate from
the macroprogram memory.  But a unified macro- and micro-program
store allows the programmer to write microcode and add new
macroinstructions -- a valuable educational tool.  Such an
"extensible instruction set" in a stack machine is evocative of
the programming language Forth, and this concept has been
anticipated by several dedicated Forth processors [4].</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><h2>Glaring Deficiencies</h2><p>
</p><p>
     Many weaknesses of the PISC become evident after a short
period of use, including:</p><p>
</p><p>
  a) no conditional branch microinstruction -- an important need
     [6];<br>
  b) no provision for literal values in the microinstruction;<br>
  c) no ALU logic for multiply, divide, and right shift;<br>
  d) no logic for decoding of macroinstructions;<br>
  e) no provision for interrupts;<br>
  f) sparse coding of the ALU function select; and<br>
  g) two clocks required per microinstruction.</p><p>
</p><p>
     It can be argued that the PISC is a valuable educational
tool because these faults, and several potential solutions, are
painfully obvious.  Some faults cannot be rectified without
substantial added logic, or an expansion of the microinstruction
word.  But several improvements are trivial.</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><h2>ALU Operation Decoding</h2><p>
</p><p>
     Seven bits of the 16-bit microinstruction (including the
carry input select) select the ALU function.  Fewer than 32 of
the 128 codes are actually useful, however.  A "nanocode" memory
[3], or combinational logic, could reduce the ALU field(s)
from seven to five bits.</p><p>
     Alternatively, unused function codes can be decoded to
generate auxiliary control signals.  For example, the carry input
select (IR6:5) is a "don't-care" for logic operations (IR4=1).
Thus 48 of the 64 logic function codes can be used for other
purposes.  A single 74138 can provide eight supplementary control
signals, such as interrupt enable and disable.  Additional logic
can prevent the ALU output from being written to a register, if
desired.</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><h2>Conditional ALU Operations</h2><p>
</p><p>
     A simple conditional microinstruction modifies the ALU
function according to the carry status.  Two modifications are
useful:</p><p>
</p><p>
  a) if carry set, change ALU operation from "A" to "B" 
     (conditional jump)<br>
  b) if carry set, change ALU operation from "A" to "A+B" 
     (conditional branch)</p><p>
</p><p>
     Unused ALU functions can be decoded for these operations,
and suitable logic added to alter the ALU function select inputs.
This does, however, add delay to the critical timing path of the
CPU.</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><h2>Interrupts</h2><p>
</p><p>
     Two kinds of interrupts can be added easily to the PISC.
Microinterrupts can be implemented by having the interrupt set a
flip-flop, changing the program counter in the fetch pseudo-
instruction from R7 to R6.  R6 must be dedicated as an interrupt
service register, and an additional control signal must be
decoded to reset the flip-flop.  (The RCA 1802 used a similar
interrupt scheme.)</p><p>
     Macrointerrupts can be recognized by the microinterpreter by
adding a conditional skip and an interrupt service routine to the
microinterpreter.  The interrupt input is connected to the carry
input multiplexer, replacing the little-used A=B input.  The
interpreter is slowed by only one microinstruction.</p><p>
     In either case, registers and the status latch must be saved
and restored by microcode.  Logic to disable the interrupt inputs
is desirable.</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><h2>Multiple Memory Spaces</h2><p>
</p><p>
     Many processors, such as the PDP-11, enforce a division of
instruction and data space.  Since the bits that select the PISC
address register are available, and R7 is the program counter, a
three-input NAND gate can produce an "instruction space" enable
signal.  This signal is correctly asserted for immediate
addressing mode.</p><p>
     Further segmentation of the memory space depends upon the
register assignment for the macro machine.  One 2-to-4 decoder
can identify microcode, macrocode, stack, and data spaces in the
threaded stack machine.  (This is suggestive of the 80x86.)</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><h2>Parallelism</h2><p>
</p><p>
     If the microcode memory space is separate from main memory,
the fetch and execute phases can occur in parallel, and each
microinstruction can execute in one clock cycle (Fig. 2).  A 12-bit 
(optionally 16-bit) counter serves as a rudimentary
microsequencer.  This liberates the ALU from its sequencer role,
and eliminates the need for the fetch pseudo-instruction.  Each
clock cycle fetches a microinstruction from the microprogram ROM.</p><p>
<img src="./pisc - PATHETIC INSTRUCTION SET COMPUTER - A Minimal TTL Processor for Architecture Exploration_files/piscf2.gif"></p><p>
     Absolute jumps are still possible by loading the counter
from the ALU or Data bus.  But ALU operations on the program
counter are no longer permitted, eliminating the relative branch,
conditional skip, and immediate addressing capabilities.
Microinterrupts are also lost; macrointerrupts become
impractical.</p><p>
     Since each microinstruction is executed one clock cycle
after it is fetched (Fig. 2), a jump instruction will experience
a one-clock-cycle delay, and the instruction following a jump
will always be executed.  This is the "delayed branch" seen in
most microprogrammed machines and some pipelined RISC machines.</p><p>
     With this configuration, a main memory access need not
complete in one clock cycle.  The limiting factors in clock speed
are the ALU path and the microinstruction ROM.  Preliminary
studies indicate that the clock speed of the PISC can be doubled,
with two clock cycles required for a main memory reference.</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><h2>Load/Store (RISC-like) Operation</h2><p>
</p><p>
     A further modification (Fig. 3) re-unifies the microcode
and macrocode memories.  During ALU operations the address buffer
is disabled, and fetch and execution remain simultaneous.  But
during a memory load or store, the output of the PC is tri-stated 
and the address buffer enabled, allowing the ALU to
address the main memory (PROM' and RAM').  The count input of the
PC is also disabled, and the IR is loaded with a "dummy"
instruction (NOP).  After the memory access is complete, the
dummy instruction executes and the PC fetches the next
instruction.</p><p>
<img src="./pisc - PATHETIC INSTRUCTION SET COMPUTER - A Minimal TTL Processor for Architecture Exploration_files/piscf3.gif"></p><p>
     In this configuration the PISC can be viewed as a load/store
architecture [3].  Like a RISC machine, all instructions
execute in one clock cycle, except for memory references which
require two.</p><p>
     If the address buffer is bidirectional, the PC can be routed
to the ALU.  This restores the relative branch, conditional skip,
and immediate addressing capabilities.</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><h2>The "Mutable PISC"</h2><p>
</p><p>
     It would be unreasonable to hand students "a bag of parts"
and a wirewrap tool, and expect them to construct the PISC as a
class exercise.  More attractive to the student, and perhaps less
attractive to the experimenter, would be a printed-circuit-board
of the basic PISC and its simpler enhancements.  This is
envisioned as the PISC-2 (Fig. 3).</p><p>
     The PISC-2 will use the Am29705 register file instead of the
obsolescent and scarce 74172.  This will require the addition of
a 16-bit Data latch, and a few more control signals.  Rather than
expand the microinstruction word, a minimal function decoder will
be added.  </p><p>
     By judicious insertion and removal of components, the PISC-2
can be configured as a PISC-1 (two-clock instructions), a
separate microprogram machine, or a load/store machine.  Program
development in the "unified memory" configurations could be via
keypad and display, or an RS-232 serial port, using an on-board
monitor program.  </p><p>
</p><p>
</p><h2>Conclusions</h2><p>
</p><p>
     An educational drawback of the PISC is its abysmal implementation 
of "conventional" (1- or 2-operand) macromachines.  This
is a consequence of the PISC's original "mission": a stack processor 
using a minimum of standard TTL logic (2100 gates).  But
the PISC-1 vividly teaches that power does not necessarily imply
complexity.  Compare the speed of a 5 MHz PISC-1a to a 5 MHz
8086, when executing eForth primitives (given as number of 200
nsec clock cycles):</p><p>

     A processor design remarkably similar to the PISC, the QS2,
has been successfully used in a VLSI design course [5].  The
PISC has the advantage of being built from standard TTL; thus, it
is within the reach of even the most impoverished institutions
and students.</p><p>
