Things to do as of september, 26, 2017:

Logisim project:
-ret_addr register		OK
-more flags (Carry, etc)
-input device (keyboard)
-magnitude comparison instructions
-implement "DO NOTHING WITH A" or "RETURN A" ALU operation (S0 to S3 = L, M = L, C = H), useful to set flags without change register		OK
