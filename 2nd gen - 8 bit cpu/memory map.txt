16 bit memory addressing:

FRAM		0000		48 kb
		BFFF

RAM		C000		16 kb
		FFFF



FAT (inside FRAM):
	bytes
name 	8
start addr	2
size	2



VRAM (inside RAM)




- address 0x0000 will contain boot code, which will copy a certain program code from FRAM to RAM and execute
- except from the boot code, all code will run from RAM, not from FRAM (to preserve the flash memory from unnecessary wear), therefore should be copied into RAM before execution
