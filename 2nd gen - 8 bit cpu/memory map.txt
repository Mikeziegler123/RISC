12 bit addressing memory (4kb, 4096 bytes), (0x000 to 0xfff addresses):

		Hex	Dec

FRAM/EEPROM	000	      0		3 kb
		BFF	3071

RAM		C00	3072		1 kb
		FFF	4095



FAT (inside FRAM):
	bytes
name 	8
start addr	2
size	2



FRAM addr:
0x000	boot code (copies program from 0x100 to RAM-0xC00 and execute it)
0x100	prompt/home menu
0x200	function library
0x300	FAT
0x400	file system






- address 0x000 will contain boot code, which will copy a certain program code from FRAM to RAM and execute
- except from the boot code, all code will run from RAM, not from FRAM (to preserve the flash memory from unnecessary wear / improve performance (??) ), therefore should be copied into RAM before execution
