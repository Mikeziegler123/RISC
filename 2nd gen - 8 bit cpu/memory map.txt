12 bit memory addressing:

FRAM/EEPROM	000	      0		3 kb
		BFF	3071

RAM		C00	3072		1 kb
		FFF	4095



FAT (inside FRAM):
	bytes
name 	8
start addr	2
size	2








- address 0x000 will contain boot code, which will copy a certain program code from FRAM to RAM and execute
- except from the boot code, all code will run from RAM, not from FRAM (to preserve the flash memory from unnecessary wear / improve performance), therefore should be copied into RAM before execution
